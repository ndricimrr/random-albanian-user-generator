    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      This website is an open-source attempt at providing developers with a
      simple-to-use user interface for generating random Albanian user data,
      including customized names, surnames, street names, and phone numbers.
      Additionally, random images are generated to depict people of different
      ages, aiming to provide the closest-to-real-life data for developers. The
      app is also used for generating names for fun purposes.

      collection. Your privacy is important to us, and we want to make it clear
      that we do not store or track any user information.
